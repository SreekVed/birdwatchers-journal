# Birdwatcher's Journal
A very simple program that does not have a GUI and can only be executed from a command line.
The journal records both the common and Latin names of birds, as well as the number of times each bird was seen. The program has the following commands : 

Add - adds a bird to the journal

Observation - records the observation of a bird

Statistics - prints all the birds along with the number of times they were observed

Show - prints the name and observations of a single bird

Quit - terminates the program
